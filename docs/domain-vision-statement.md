# Domain Vision Statement

The domain model will represent people involved in heliophysics research activities
and will represent and support online and offline interactions among these people.
The model of a person should reflect the personal relationships that research organizations such as NASA
are striving to cultivate in order to increase the impact of current funded heliophysics research activities
and to nurture resilient workforce capacity for future research initiatives.

The model should represent the history of a person in useful condensed form,
including participation in identified activities and initiatives, affiliation with identified groups, and so on.

The model should also represent activities and initiatives as connected to concepts of an organized concept scheme,
to support network search and timely recommendation based on topic-interest alignments
with the goal of usefully connecting a person to other people, activities, and initiatives.

## About

A <span class="term">Domain Vision Statement</span>[^1] is a short description (about one page)
of the <span class="term">core domain</span> and the value it will bring, the "value proposition."
Ignore those aspects that do not distinguish this domain model from others.
Show how the domain model serves and balances diverse interests.
Keep it narrow.
Write this statement early and revise it as you gain new insight.

It should be usable directly by the management and technical staff during all phases of development
to guide resource allocation, to guide modeling choices, and to educate team members.

# HelioWeb

A Platform for the Future of Heliophysics (Augmentation to the [Center for HelioAnalytics (CfHA)](https://www.helioanalytics.io/what-is-cfha) Internal Scientist Funding Model (ISFM) @ [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)).

## Summary

Heliophysics data are increasingly complex.
Information is spread across hundreds of observing platforms across the solar-terrestrial system, simulation frameworks, and projects (individuals, groups, and institutions).
Frontier scientific progress and the advancement of our community hinges on the development of novel technologies to enable research with large and diverse datasets and across traditional disciplinary boundaries.
The HelioWeb white paper developed for the Heliophysics 2050 Workshop [^1] identifies the value of a fully connected, online platform for discovery and collaboration.

We propose here the first steps towards the creation of a HelioWeb that will connect researchers and resources on a single portal through which all community connections are catalogued, interlinked, and discoverable.
These first steps will be a combined effort with the [Heliophysics Digital Resource Library (HDRL)](https://hdrl.gsfc.nasa.gov/), spearheaded by the Center for Helioanalytics, and driven by the vision of HelioWeb to catalyze the creation of a community project to accelerate heliophysics research into the future.

## Near-term goal

Prepare a demo suitable for gathering feedback
at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) [Fall Meeting](https://www.agu.org/fall-meeting)
the week of 11-15 December 2023.

## Data Model

[Domain Vision Statement](docs/domain-vision-statement.md)

## Data Management Plan

All tools, code, and databases funded through the Helioweb proposal will be made publicly available per NASA guidelines and open source directives though collaboration with the Heliophysics Digital Research Library (HDRL) at Goddard Space Flight Center.
